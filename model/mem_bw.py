    Calculate the bandwidth a simple continuous PCIe memory read of

    PCIe memory reads require bandwidth in both directions: TX for sending
    requests and RX for receiving the data (PCIe Completions with Data).

    avail_??_bw is assumed to be of the same type for both RX and TX

    The read data is broken up into M PCIe completions with data
    transactions.  Typically the first completion will align to Read
    Completion Boundary (RCB) and remaining completions will be
    multiples of RCB till the last completion.

    For simplicity we assume that read requests are aligned to
    boundaries.  Depending on 'rcb_chunks' we break the completion in
    RCB sized chunks or MPS sized chunks.  RCB sized chunks have been
    observed on several older chipsets.
